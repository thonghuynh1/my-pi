/*
 * build-client.mjs — copy the Accordion app's static browser build into the
 * extension for publishing.
 *
 * The extension serves the SvelteKit build over HTTP on its ephemeral port (see
 * accordion.ts → handleHttp). In the repo dev layout it serves straight from
 * ../app/build; when the extension is PUBLISHED as a package the app source isn't
 * present, so we vendor the build into ./dist/client (the first directory
 * resolveClientRoot() probes). This script produces that copy.
 *
 * Run: node ./build-client.mjs   (or `npm run build:client`)
 * Prereq: run `npm run build` in ../app first so app/build exists.
